## Version v0.1.2 (March 23rd, 2023)

There was a small bug in the code that resulted in qiskit circuit not compiling, resulting in erros on QPUs
* This bug was fixed
* Two additional unittests were added to test for compilation to avoid these errors in future.

## Version v0.1.1 (February 23rd, 2023)

This release brings the following new features:
* The ability to plug in custom qubit routing solutions for QAOA circuits. 
* AWS managed jobs are now supported through OpenQAOA

## What's Changed

* Refactor
  * The new `GateMapLabel` introduces an updated and a more consistent way to label QAOA gates in the circuit. 
* New Features
  * OpenQAOA now supports specifying custom qubit routing algorithms in an expected format in the QAOA workflow. This is implemented in https://github.com/entropicalabs/openqaoa/pull/179


## Version v0.1.0 (February 17th, 2023)

This release brings major changes to the structure of OpenQAOA. 
This is OpenQAOA's first major release! V0.1.0 contains many new features and quite a few **breaking changes** :)

**notice**: the license has been changed from `apache 2.0` to `MIT`

## What's Changed

* Refactor
  * The code underwent a considerable refactoring effort. The most noticeable change is in the new `openqaoa-core` and other library plugins in the form `openqaoa-xyz`.
